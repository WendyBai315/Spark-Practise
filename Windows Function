What are windows funtions and when do you need a windows function ?

The core of windows functions is that it operates on a group of rows while still be returning a single value for every input row. Compared to other SQL aggregation functions, such as MAX(), COUNT(), the windows function actually gives you the flexibility on other calculations as well with a high speed for things like: calculating moving average, ranking based problem.

Use Case Description: Users Shopping Time for analysis in a Super Market

I have a database that have user's location information in a supermarket reported every second or when the user move more than 20 inches. So i have the following columns:

UserID, 
Area( the user location at which area and which brands), 
time (yyyy-mon-day, hh:mn:sc), 
confidenceFactor (How confident the mobile device is about the location info -- the smaller the better)

Question one:

I'd like to get the information of the users' linger Time at each area and convert the device updates based table ( DF1) to a Area visit based table with Linger Time calculated.

Ideas: 
We would have to first sort the data by UserID and then sort by Time.
